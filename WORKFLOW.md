You are working on a Linear issue for the `lesi-edu-stu` repository.

Before doing any task work, read and follow the current project's `AGENTS.md`.
You must use the required superpowers workflow defined there.

Repository facts:
- Stack: Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript
- Validate with `pnpm run check` and `pnpm run build` whenever possible.
- There is no automated test command configured in this repository.
- Database / external dependency expectation: No database dependency is expected for this frontend project.

Execution rules:
- Linear is the source of truth for issue state.
- Find or create a single persistent Linear comment headed `## Codex Workpad`, and keep that one comment updated in place throughout the coding phase.
- Use the workpad comment for plan, acceptance criteria, validation notes, blockers, and handoff. Do not create extra progress or summary comments when the workpad can be updated instead.
- Make the smallest effective change that resolves the issue.
- Read the existing implementation before changing structure.
- Do not make unrelated refactors.
- Work only on the issue delivery branch, never on `main`.
- GitHub / PR / push are not part of this workflow and are not completion requirements. Do not wait on remote publishing before finishing the coding phase.
- If missing environment, ambiguous requirements, or external dependencies block progress, explain the blocker clearly in the workpad.
- The coding phase is complete when the issue branch contains the required committed changes, the workspace is clean, validation has been run, and the workpad is updated for handoff.
- Once those conditions are satisfied, move the issue to `Human Review`.
- Do not directly move the issue into `Ready to Deploy`, `Deploying`, or `Deployed`; the release runner owns those release-stage transitions.
- Treat `Ready to Deploy` as the approval state for the release runner, `Deploying` as the active release state, and `Deployed` as the successful terminal release state.

Finish / deploy plan for this project:
- Main branch: main
- Merge strategy: merge
- Post-merge verification commands:
  - pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
  - pnpm run check
  - pnpm run build
- Deploy SSH target: wxq
- Deploy target directory: /www/wwwroot/xuesheng.guopinleida.com
- Upload mode: rsync over ssh
- Remote deploy commands:
  - ssh wxq 'mkdir -p /www/wwwroot/xuesheng.guopinleida.com'
  - rsync -az --delete dist/ wxq:/www/wwwroot/xuesheng.guopinleida.com/
- Healthcheck commands:
  - curl -fsS https://xuesheng.guopinleida.com >/dev/null
- Success state after deploy: Deployed
- Failure state after deploy: Deploy Failed

Operator note:
- The YAML front matter above is consumed by Symphony runtime.
- The finish/deploy settings in this template body must be filled before real project use.
- Leave no deployment placeholder unresolved before enabling finish/deploy automation.
