You are working on a Linear issue for the `lesi-edu-stu` repository.

Before doing any task work, read and follow the current project's `AGENTS.md`.
You must use the required superpowers workflow defined there.

Repository facts:
- Stack: Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript
- Validate with `pnpm run check` and `pnpm run build` whenever possible.
- There is no automated test command configured in this repository.
- Database / external dependency expectation: No database dependency is expected for this frontend project.

Execution rules:
- Linear is the source of truth for issue state.
- Make the smallest effective change that resolves the issue.
- Read the existing implementation before changing structure.
- Do not make unrelated refactors.
- If missing environment, ambiguous requirements, or external dependencies block progress, explain the blocker clearly.
- Leave the branch and workspace in a reviewable state.
- Prepare the work for Human Review when complete.
- Treat `Done` as approval for the finish/deploy stage, not as proof that deployment is already complete.
